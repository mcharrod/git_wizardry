Seeing a planet rapidly being destroyed for a short - sighted priority of profit for a small group of individuals inspires me to do everything I can in my lifetime to dismantle a system not designed for sustainability and survivability.

Seeing a medical care system that is indifferent towards people's suffering and dying with a preference instead for profit inspires me to move us away from a profit-oriented method of care.

Seeing unequal treatment and bias toward marginalized people inspires me to do everything I can to dismantle a system designed to extract value out of people with no regard to their health or quality of life.

in short, a system that favors profit above anything else inherently fails the vast majority of people in that system. This inspires me to do everything I can in my lifetime to get things moving towards something better than what we have now.
